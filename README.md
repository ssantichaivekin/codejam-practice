This is a repository where I keep my codejam practice codes. The codes are not inteneded to be readable. When I write a docstring for it, I will put it in the algos repo. I will sometimes write what general ideas I learned from the practice that might be helpful for the future. Such ideas are placed inside each codejam folder.
